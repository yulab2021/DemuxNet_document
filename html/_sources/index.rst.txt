DemuxNet is a machine learning-augmented tool for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)
sample demultiplexing. It automates assignment of cells to samples in pooled runs
and predicts missing Cell Multiplexing Oligo (CMO) labels for barcodes with
incomplete or ambiguous CMO information.

For more information, please refer to our manuscript: [******].
